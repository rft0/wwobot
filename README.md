## What it does?
Working mechanism is simple, it creates websocket clients and route them to a room, sending packages to spam chat room. The WWO app for mobile use react native because of continously rendering state it will make other client to experience a slowdown hereby most of the time their app will either crash or freeze.

## Requirements:
* Python 3.*

* If you count on me just use binary executables from `Releases`, otherwise you can run script manually.
* Run `INSTALL.bat` to install dependencies for first time.
* After first time just run `RUN.bat`.
